It maintains two values, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which represent respectively the **minimum score** that the maximizing player is assured of and the **maximum score** that the minimizing player is assured of. *Initially, $\\alpha$ is negative infinity and $\\beta$ is positive infinity, i.e. both players start with their worst possible score*. \n",
